# TUC: The Truly Universal Converter

This is a simple novelty program based on the tendency in the media to measure things metaphorically, e.g., "an asteroild the size of ten washing machines", and also the ongoing gag that Americans will use anything for measurement other than the metric system.

Simply put, it allows you to choose a measurement (length, area, timespan, whatever) and convert it from one unit of measurement to another. I've included "normal" units of measurement so that you can convert them to sillier ones or vice-versa.

Numbers-to-words code is by Stephen Chapman. I did make a couple of changes, allowing for quadrillion & quintillion, and adding punctuation where it helped readability.

Got suggestions for measuring units to add? Drop 'em in an issue.
